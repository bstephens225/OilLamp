My approach to this project was to first come up with a concept. I first decided I wanted my game to have a slightly creepy feeling and then I thought about the idea of a game that tries to gaslight you. I decided I wanted to take that literally and have the player reliant on a gas lamp that claimed to last forever (but wouldn't).
